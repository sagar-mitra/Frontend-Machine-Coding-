    question: 'Can I customize the default theme in Tailwind CSS?',

    question: 'How does Tailwind handle responsive design?',
    answer:
      "Tailwind uses a mobile-first approach with responsive modifiers like sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, and 2xl: that can be added to any utility class. For example, 'md:flex' will apply flex only on medium screens and above. This makes creating responsive layouts intuitive and straightforward.",

    question: 'Does Tailwind increase my final bundle size?',
    answer:
      "While Tailwind's development build is large, it uses PurgeCSS in production to scan your template files and remove unused CSS. This results in very small file sizes in production. With Tailwind v4.0, the bundling process is even more efficient, resulting in smaller CSS output.",
